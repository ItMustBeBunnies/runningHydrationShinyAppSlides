slidified slides introducing the running hydration prediction shiny app

## Viewing the slides
Getting the html5 slidepack published was not without tribulation. This was not helped by the slidify publish()
function being out of date and finishing with a <browseURL(link)> command where <link = sprintf("http://%s.github.com/%s", username, repo)>
and github no longer redirects from xxx.github.com to xxx.github.io resulting in a fair amount of wasted time when
the publish had actually worked! 

I've viewed the slides at the .github.io address (eventually) and all seems in order. If anything got mangled with
the coursera link, hopefully you can access my slides on github.io from [this](http://itmustbebunnies.github.io/runningHydrationShinyAppSlides)
